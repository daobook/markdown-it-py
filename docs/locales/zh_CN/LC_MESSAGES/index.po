"For a good introduction to [markdown-it] see the __[Live demo](https"
"://markdown-it.github.io)__. This is a Python port of the well used "
"[markdown-it], and some of its associated plugins. The driving design "
"philosophy of the port has been to change as little of the fundamental "
"code structure (file names, function name, etc) as possible, just "
"sprinkling in a little Python syntactical sugar âœ¨. It is very simple to "
"write complimentary extensions for both language implementations!"
