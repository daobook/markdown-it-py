"Input data is parsed via nested chains of rules. There are 3 nested "
"chains - `core`, `block` & `inline`:"

#: ../../architecture.md:35
msgid ""
"The result of the parsing is a *list of tokens*, that will be passed to "
"the `renderer` to generate the html content."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:37
msgid ""
"These tokens can be themselves parsed again to generate more tokens (ex: "
"a `list token` can be divided into multiple `inline tokens`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:39
msgid ""
"An `env` sandbox can be used alongside tokens to inject external "
"variables for your parsers and renderers."

"Each chain (core / block / inline) uses an independent `state` object "

"Instead of traditional AST we use more low-level data representation - "
"*tokens*. The difference is simple:"

"Why not AST? Because it's not needed for our tasks. We follow KISS "

msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:79
msgid ""
"Rules are functions, doing \"magic\" with parser `state` objects. A rule "
"is associated with one or more *chains* and is unique. For instance, a "
"`blockquote` token is associated with `blockquote`, `paragraph`, "
"`heading` and `list` chains."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:81
msgid ""
"Rules are managed by names via [Ruler](https://markdown-it.github.io"
"/markdown-it/#Ruler) instances and can be  `enabled` / `disabled` from "
"the [MarkdownIt](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/#MarkdownIt) "
"methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:83
msgid ""
"You can note, that some rules have a `validation mode` - in this mode "
"rules do not modify the token stream, and only look ahead for the end of "
"a token. It's one important design principle - a token stream is \"write "
"only\" on block & inline parse stages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:87
msgid ""
"Parsers are designed to keep rules independent of each other. You can "
"safely enable/disable them, or add new ones. There are no universal "
"recipes for how to create new rules - design of distributed state "
"machines with good data isolation is a tricky business. But you can "
"investigate existing rules & plugins to see possible approaches."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, in complex cases you can try to ask for help in tracker. Condition "
"is very simple - it should be clear from your ticket, that you studied "
"docs, sources, and tried to do something yourself. We never reject with "
"help to real developers."

msgid "Renderer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:99
msgid ""
"After the token stream is generated, it's passed to a "
"[renderer](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-"
"py/tree/master/markdown_it/renderer.py). It then plays all the tokens, "
"passing each to a rule with the same name as token type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:102
msgid ""
"Renderer rules are located in `md.renderer.rules[name]` and are simple "
"functions with the same signature:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:110
msgid ""
"In many cases that allows easy output change even without parser "
"intrusion. For example, let's replace images with vimeo links to player's"
" iframe:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:137
msgid "Here is another example, how to add `target=\"_blank\"` to all links:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:153
msgid ""
"Note, if you need to add attributes, you can do things without renderer "
"override. For example, you can update tokens in `core` chain. That is "
"slower, than direct renderer override, but can be more simple."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:157
msgid ""
"You also can write your own renderer to generate other formats than HTML,"
" such as JSON/XML... You can even use it to generate AST."

"This was mentioned in [Data flow](#data-flow), but let's repeat sequence "

#: ../../architecture.md:165
msgid "Blocks are parsed, and top level of token stream filled with block tokens."
